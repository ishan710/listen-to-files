## Reflection on creative process


This project is inspired by a piece we saw in class where an artist used a gray scale image and vertical scroller that produced sound whenever the scroller intersected with the image. I wanted to do something similar where I used an outside
source to produce melody. In my case, I am using any file, reading the binary contents, mapping the contents to musical notes to make melodies. 

Initially, I was just mapping one binary character to a note, due to which
the melody wasn't very pleasant but just a random bit of major scales notes.
I changed that by playing different note at different octaves which made the piece sound more melodic.

In terms od challenges, I found it hard for the different octaves to line up.
I tried using ChatGPT but its solution was very unnecessa. Ultimitely, I had to dive deaper into the Tone.js documentation to figure out the best way of doing it.
